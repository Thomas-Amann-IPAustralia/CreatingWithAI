WIC AI Image Equity Challenge: Workshop Resources
Welcome to the companion GitHub repository for the "AI Image Equity Challenge" hands-on workshop! This repository is designed to be a central hub for all workshop participants, whether you're a seasoned pro or just getting started. Here you'll find the resources and "best practices" we'll use in the workshop, so you can continue to learn and create even after the session ends.

The AI Image Equity Challenge, organized by Women in Information and Communication (WIC), is a celebration of women's contributions to technology. Their goal is to create AI-generated images that put women in tech at the center of the frame, showing what's possible when combining artistic insight with inclusive innovation.
